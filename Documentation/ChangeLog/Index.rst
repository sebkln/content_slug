1. Releases

   You can find an `overview of all releases on GitHub <https://github.com/sebkln/content_slug/releases>`__.

2. Changelog

   The best changelog is the `GitHub commit log <https://github.com/sebkln/content_slug/commits/master>`__.

   I use commit messages to document some design decisions and to explain new features briefly.

3. Blog articles

   If a version contains new features or important changes, I'll write a blog post about it (available in English and German):
