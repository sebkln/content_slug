1.) Getting human-readable anchors
==================================

You can use the following text field to set a more readable anchor for a
TYPO3 content element.

The button on the right allows you to automatically generate an anchor from the
current contents of the header field.
You can, of course, modify the anchor afterwards.

.. figure:: ../../Images/EditorManual/field-fragment.png
   :width: 910px
   :alt: Human-readable URL anchor
   :class: with-shadow

   Text field for a human-readable URL anchor

2.) Extra: Adding a new link next to the header
===============================================

Please hover your mouse cursor over a heading in this tutorial.
Do you see the **link symbol** showing up next to it?

It allows you to navigate to this section of the page–exactly like the
menu links which were mentioned in the preface above.

If you activate this checkbox in your content element (and you filled the
URL anchor field), a link like this will be added to the header:

.. figure:: ../../Images/EditorManual/field-anchor-link.png
   :width: 910px
   :alt: Set link to anchor
   :class: with-shadow

   Checkbox to show an additional link anchor next to the header

.. note::

   You may not see this checkbox. That would mean that your administrator has
   disabled it.
